# directory
Directory using mysqlAdmin, PHP, and Bootstrap.

This project is divided into two parts: a GUI to update a directory database and multiple files that will used as signage screens. The GUI is connected to a mysql database locally hosted. The signage files pull information from the database and format it using Bootstrap.


Conclusion from project:


Work on PHP skills: This includes database managing and credentials, fetching information.

Consider using Ajax: Since most of the changes are minimal, it shouldn't have to refresh or go to a new page for every update.

Increase modularity: Use of blocks would help with setting up new signage screens more easily and it also makes it easier to understand to the next person.

Naming convention: Could use better names to make project files easy to navigate.
